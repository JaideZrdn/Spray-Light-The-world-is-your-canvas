We live in a space that is increasingly being taken over by tall buildings, gray skies, and crowds walking back and forth, where all these people are always busy in some kind of “**autopilot**.”

In the midst of all this monotony, there is _graffiti_. It is an art meant to be seen and appreciated, but many graffiti artists struggle to gain recognition and end up being viewed negatively by society, despite having the simple and beautiful role of brightening someone’s day.

So, in an effort to redefine how society sees _graffiti_ and break the “_autopilot_” routine, we created **Spray Light**.

## What is Spray Light?

With **Spray Light**, you can spread _graffiti_ across the city’s walls, making it possible to view them using **Augmented Reality**. Each graffiti you place leaves a **pin** on the **map** to help you remember where you posted it. When you get close and activate AR mode, you’ll be able to see them.

With this, we aim to:
- **Change** the marginalized perception society has of _graffiti_ 
- **Encourage** the emergence of new graffiti artists, initially showcasing their art in **virtual form**!

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: For the development of the overall app UI
- **RealityKit & ARKit**: For managing processes involving the entire Augmented Reality dynamic, such as posting, translation, object rotation, creation of new entities, and other tasks.
- **SwiftData & DTO**: To save graffiti locally and use Data Transfer Objects (DTO) for secure data transfer via the app using Sendables
- **UIKit**: Used to initiate ARView in UIViewRepresentables
- **TipKit**: To enhance the user experience and provide guidance on some features during app usage
